Project: This project is about the Ghost Pipe plant and explains different things about it such as toxicity, culture, ecology, etc.

Some of the nested routes we have are a reproduction info page within the about page, filters on the gallery page, and clicking on the cards in the medicine and culture pages will show you new content. You can also add your own references and record your observations of ghost pipes on the ecology page.
