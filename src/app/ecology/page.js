      <p>
        Ecology is a branch of science that studies the relationships between
        organisms and their environments.
      </p>
      <p>{`Ghost pipes don't photosynthesize normally like most other plants, instead they get nutrients from the fungi that grow near tree roots. The fungi are in a symbiotic relationship with the tree where the fungi provide minerals like phosphate and the tree provides some of it's energy from photosynthesis. The ghost pipe is in a parasitic relationship with these fungi and take the energy they get from the tree. Ghost Pipes then use cellular respiration using the nutrients they get for energy.`}</p>
